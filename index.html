            <p>I never

                If I died
                We'd be together
                I can't always just forget her
                But she could try
                At the end of the world
                Or the last thing I see
                You are never coming home, never coming home
                Could I? Should I?
                And all the things that you never ever told me
                And all the smiles that are ever, ever...
                Ever get the feeling that you're never all alone?
                And I remember now
                At the top of my lungs in my arms she dies
                She dies
                At the end of the world
                Or the last thing I see

                And all the things that you never ever told me
                And all the smiles that are ever gonna haunt me
                Never coming home, never coming home
                Could I? Should I?
                And all the wounds that are ever gonna scar me
                For all the ghosts that are never gonna catch me
